I once again decided that I was tired enough to take a break and watch whatever YouTube suggested to me. After some time, I was able to tear myself away, not feeling rested but rather the opposite, barely remembering what I had watched. This is a common story.

It would be nice to have a phone where I couldn't watch YouTube, I thought. But what I found was either unreasonably priced or didn't suit me.

One of the phones I considered was the Light Phone, with its black-and-white screen. I liked this and began to search for something similar on the iPhone. It turned out that it was possible to do this by going to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Color Filters, toggling Color Filters on, and selecting Grayscale.

Now all those bright video thumbnails, online store products, call-to-action buttons, and other attention-grabbing elements simply blend into the background and lose their appeal. Try doing this on your own phone and open YouTube â€“ you just won't feel like watching all those videos.

I observed several positive aspects:
- The notification badges on app icons do not stand out.
- I read text more attentively.
- I pay less attention to images.
- I don't linger in apps or websites longer than necessary to achieve my initial goal.

Most likely, you won't even want to use your phone unnecessarily after such a setup. But as a bonus, it saves energy for other things. For example, I started writing here, and it brings more joy than watching videos. With doomscrolling, you don't get the sense of having accomplished anything, a feeling of completion, or achieving results.

A week after setting my phone to black and white, I did the same to my computer. In the evening, reading news or blogs with such a palette is quite comfortable, but sometimes it causes inconvenience. Occasionally, different colors display as the same shade of gray, blending with the background or each other. It's good if you know when something should be there and it's not visible, but in unfamiliar situations, you might miss something.

I've been using devices in black-and-white mode for three weeks now and have become accustomed enough to feel discomfort when switching to color mode. It seems that I feel calmer, especially when I need to find something amidst a large number of similar elements on a page, such as on marketplaces.
