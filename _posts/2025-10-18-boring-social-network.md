I think the time has come for a new social network or content delivery methods. Something new should replace Facebook, X, and others, where people will have the ability to choose who can see their content and what content they will receive themselves. There will be a demand for confidence that, thanks to the transparency of algorithms and open-source software, they will receive information only from sources they consider trustworthy.

This thought is prompted by the fact that AI is becoming more "autonomous" due to the development of tools for working with it. By acting in old ways for advertising, more content will be generated. Understanding what to believe and what not to will become almost impossible. There has been evidence for more than a year that speech is analyzed through microphones on various devices to show users ads for products they mentioned when a phone or other device was nearby.

Now it is not hard to imagine that the development of advertising mechanisms will lead to a situation where, after a series of "random" events in your news feed, videos you watch after work on a social network, or songs you listen to, you will come to the thought that you need something. This could be anything, from pasta of a different brand, a subscription to the nearest gym, to investments and changing banks. Only this desire will be carefully engineered by AI algorithms, after training on your data.

Perhaps through mechanisms of electronic signatures, fact-checking, encryption, and others, there is a possibility to limit companies' influence on the use and spread of manipulative content.

Such a social network should be paid to be independent from investors. Large companies, in their youth, represented the interests of people, which is why they gained an audience. To grow, they sold themselves for investments and now must follow the demands of investors.
